## Speculative Documentation Driven Use cases

Just committed and pushed my code. Has CI finished?

```console
$ gh-sup
commit 25c6b01f1c8572e880b2d97e416a89c51b295c0b
Author: Josh Nichols <technicalpickles@github.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 17 10:04:25 2018 -0400

    Fix spec

heaven passed
heaven-ruby2-warning passed
```

Starting up for the day, I wonder if there's any changes to check on.

```console
$ gh-sup
New changes on origin/branch, git pull, and all that.
